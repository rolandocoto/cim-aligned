C# Error Calculation

This program was made in 2015, to measure the differences in alignment between two TextGrids with the exact same phonemes and words. The program also has code to replace ARPAbet letters with the actual orthography of the language.

I used this for Me'phaa, but it can also be used for Cook Islands MƒÅori. At some point I have to make this into a Python program.
